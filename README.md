## üìñ Overview

Cloudflare-Dynamic-DNS-Updater is a simple application that allows you to keep your domain name updated when your IP address changes. If you have your own domain name, this script uses Cloudflare's services to provide free dynamic IP updates. You no longer need to pay for services like DynDNS; this script does the same job without the cost.
